The 1st edition of RobOntics will take place during the [FOIS2021 Conference](https://fois2021.inf.unibz.it/) in Bolzano (13-16 September). The exact date of the workshop is to be defined.

We intend for the workshop to allow both online and physical participation. Of course, we will monitor the ongoing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our plans accordingly.

Researchers who have accepted papers at RobOntics 2020 are kindly invited to present their work, and they may also submit newer work for consideration for RobOntics 2021. The papers accepted for RobOntics 2020 have already been published in the JOWO proceedings volume for last year.
