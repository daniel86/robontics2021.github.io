Note about the COVID-19 outbreak: the workshop selects and publishes the papers in 2020 as planned but the physical meeting has been postponed to 2021 in coordination with the [FOIS 2020->2021](https://fois2020.inf.unibz.it/) conference.

We invite researchers interested in the fields of robotics and knowledge engineering to submit papers this year; survey and position papers are especially welcome. Accepted papers will be published in a JOWO proceedings volume, and there is the option of presenting them next year, when the workshop will take place.
