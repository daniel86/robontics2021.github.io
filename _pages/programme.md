The 2nd edition of RobOntics will take place during the [FOIS2021 Conference](https://fois2021.inf.unibz.it/) in Bolzano (13-16 September). The exact date of the workshop is to be defined.

We intend for the workshop to allow both online and physical participation. Of course, we will monitor the ongoing situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and adjust our plans accordingly.

Researchers are kindly invited to submit work relevant towards bridging between the robotics and ontology engineering communities. The accepted papers will then be presented in the workshop and published in a JOWO proceedings volume.
