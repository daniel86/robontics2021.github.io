Because of wide-spread restrictions caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, the workshop has been postponed to 2021 to coordinate with the larger [FOIS 2020->2021](https://fois2020.inf.unibz.it/) conference.

Nevertheless, we invite researchers interested in the fields of robotics and knowledge engineering to submit papers this year; survey and position papers are especially welcome. Accepted papers will be published in a CEUR volume, and there is the option of presenting them next year, when the workshop will take place.
